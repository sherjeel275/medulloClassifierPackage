\usage{
calcScore(myMat = NULL, mySetsUp = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{myMat}{matrix containing gene ratios for each gene signature and sample. The row names
contain the gene signatures and the column names contain the individual samples.}

\item{mySetsUp}{list of 4 containing the gene ratios associated with
each of the 4 molecular subtypes of Medulloblastoma. Provided in the data directory as
'medulloSetsUp'.}
}
\description{
Function to calculate the gene ratio for each sample.
}
\details{
This function takes 2 input parameters. The first parameter is a gene ratio matrix
in which the entries are the expression values for each gene signature. The second parameter
is a list of 4, where each list has the gene ratios associated with the 4 Medulloblastoma
subtypes.

The function takes the gene ratio matrix and computes the column mean. However, function does
not use all the values in the column. Only the values of the gene ratios associated with a given
Medulloblastoma subtype are used to compute a column mean.

The expected output is a list of two dataframes:
one is a data frame where the rownames are the Sample Identifiers and the column names are the 4 Medulloblastoma subtypes.
and the second is a data frame of t-test pvalues across all combination of subtypes per samples
}
\examples{
## load provided data
data(geneRatioOut_109401)

## Use calcScore function
myMat <- calcScore(geneRatioOut_109401)

## View contents of matrix

# mean scores
head(myMat[[1]][1:4])

# t-test pvalues
head(myMat[[2]][1:4])
